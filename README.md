## 🔭 About the Project

**Euclides Web** is a reimagine of classical geometry tools (ruler and compass) for the Artificial Intelligence era.

Unlike purely mathematical software like GeoGebra, Euclides Web incorporates an **AI Persona** trained to act as Euclid of Alexandria himself. He doesn't just calculate; he teaches, demonstrates, and engages in Socratic dialogue with the student, utilizing the infinite canvas as his digital papyrus.

## ✨ Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **🤖 AI Mentor** | A chat integrated with the Gemini API (Google) that "sees" the board and can create shapes, explain theorems, or correct constructions. |
| **📐 Infinite Canvas** | A virtual Cartesian plane with infinite zoom and pan, rendered in vector SVG for maximum precision. |
| **🧲 Smart Snap** | Magnetic attraction system that automatically detects intersections, midpoints, and grid alignments. |
| **📱 Mobile First** | Responsive interface with multi-touch gesture support (pinch-to-zoom, two-finger pan). |
| **⚡ Performance** | Built with React 19 and optimized rendering, ensuring 60 FPS even with complex constructions. |
| **💾 Persistence** | Your theorems and sketches are automatically saved in the browser. |
| **👥 Multiplayer (Beta)** | Share one workspace by link, edit together, and see collaborator cursors in real time. |

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Students and Teachers
1. **Access:** Open the [Live Demo](#).
2. **Explore:** Use the bottom bar to select tools (Point, Line, Circle).
3. **Interact:** Click the Chat button and ask: *"Master, draw an equilateral triangle."*
4. **Learn:** Watch as the AI manipulates the board in real-time.

## 🛠 Development Guide

Follow these steps to run the project locally.

### Prerequisites
*   **Node.js** 22.12 or higher (active LTS).
*   An API key from [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/).
*   A [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) project for optional multiplayer support.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/seu-usuario/euclides-web.git
    cd euclides-web
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment:**
    Copy the example and fill in your credentials:
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    `GEMINI_API_KEY` is server-only. The Supabase anon key is public by design and must never be replaced with a `service_role` or secret key.

4.  **Run:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    The app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.
    For explicit LAN testing, run `DEV_HOST=0.0.0.0 npm run dev`; the default only binds to localhost.

5.  **Validate changes:**
    ```bash
    npm run check
    npm audit --audit-level=high
    ```

## 🏗 Project Structure

For a deep dive into the architecture (Clean Code, SOLID, Design Patterns), read **[ARCHITECTURE.md](./ARCHITECTURE.md)**.

Quick directory summary:
*   `components/canvas`: SVG rendering components (dumb/presentational).
*   `hooks/`: Business logic and state management (smart/container).
*   `services/`: Realtime collaboration protocol and Gemini client integration.
*   `utils/`: Pure math (intersections, analytic geometry).

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are what make the open-source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**.

1.  Fork the Project
2.  Create your Feature Branch (`git checkout -b feature/AmazingFeature`)
3.  Commit your Changes (`git commit -m 'Add: AmazingFeature'`)
4.  Push to the Branch (`git push origin feature/AmazingFeature`)
5.  Open a Pull Request

### Multiplayer Beta Security

Shared-room URLs are bearer capabilities: anyone with the link can edit that board. Do not use the beta for sensitive information. Deployments intended for untrusted public traffic should add Supabase private-channel authorization and distributed rate limiting for `/api/chat` before general availability.
